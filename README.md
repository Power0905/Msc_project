# Bipartite Graph Generator and Critical Set Finder

## Introduction
Welcome to the Msc Project. This tool is designed to create random bipartite graphs based on user inputs and then determine the critical set for the generated graph.

## Getting Started

### Running the Program
To get started, simply run the `main` program. 

```
python main.py
```

(Note: Replace `python` with `python3` if that's the version you're using.)

### User Input
Upon running the main program, you'll be prompted to provide certain inputs. These inputs will guide the random generation of a bipartite graph.

### Results
After processing your input, the program will generate a random bipartite graph and then determine its critical set. The results will be displayed to you accordingly.

Thank you for using the Msc Project. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
